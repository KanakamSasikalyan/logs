Yes, there are alternatives to Stable Diffusion that can generate clothing designs using prompts with less computational resources. Here are a few options:

*Alternatives*
1. *CLIP-Guided Diffusion*: A text-to-image model that uses CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) to generate images based on text prompts. It's less computationally intensive than Stable Diffusion.
2. *VQGAN*: A vector quantized GAN that can generate images based on text prompts. It's known for its efficiency and can run on lower-end hardware.
3. *Pix2Pix*: A conditional GAN that can generate images based on text prompts or sketches. It's a more lightweight model compared to Stable Diffusion.

*Clothing design-specific models*
1. *OutfitVAE*: A VAE-based model that generates clothing designs based on text prompts.
2. *Fashion-Gen*: A GAN-based model that generates clothing designs based on text prompts.

*Considerations*
1. *Image quality*: Alternative models might not produce images with the same level of quality as Stable Diffusion.
2. *Prompt understanding*: Alternative models might not understand prompts as well as Stable Diffusion.
3. *Customization*: Alternative models might require more fine-tuning or customization to fit your specific use case.

*Resources*
1. *Hugging Face Models*: Explore the Hugging Face model hub for pre-trained models that can generate clothing designs.
2. *GitHub repositories*: Search for open-source implementations of clothing design generation models.
3. *Research papers*: Read research papers on clothing design generation to stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

By exploring these alternatives, you might find a model that suits your resource constraints and generates high-quality clothing designs based on prompts.
